In this assignment, you are expected to design a Dothraki to English dictionary. The Dothraki language is a constructed fictional language in George R. R. Martinâ€™s fantasy novel series A Song of Ice and Fire and its television adaptation Game of Thrones. The primary goal of this experiment is to get you to practice on the data structure called trie (or prefix tree). This special kind of a tree called trie is used to store maps of keys to values where the keys are usually strings. In your case Dothraki words are the keys and English words are the values.

In this experiment, you are expected to write an application that constructs an Dothraki-English dictionary with Trie data structure. The application will take the input.txt file from command line and read its contents. There are some commands for this experiment such as adding, deleting and listing.
