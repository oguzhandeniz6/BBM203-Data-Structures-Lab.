The main purpose of the experiment is to develop your skill of using Stack Data Structures with C++ programming language. Other purposes of the experiment are to learn Deterministic Pushdown Automata (DPDA) and also to perform file operations by using input/output libraries of C++.


You will write a program using DPDA. The program accepts a string belonging to a language or rejects a string not belonging to the language. The program is to read a description of a DPDA and one input for it. It will process an input and output the execution path. After processing one string, the program should reset the automata (this includes emptying the stack if necessary) and proceed with the next string.
